 <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Over the next month I’ll be exploring audiovisual techniques and evaluating ways of applying these techniques to events. The core aim is to capture different aspects of an event to construct an audiovisual narrative. I’m particularly interested in how visual techniques can entice a viewer to engage in film and how sound and visual work together to construct a pathos. I found some interest in boiler rooms, which film contemporary artists live. The most engaging part of these boiler rooms, is the crowd interaction which seem to funnel users attention more than the artist's process. I would like to work towards expanding these techniques.</p> 

 <h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of this, I expect to construct an audiovisual narrative that highlights the artist of the event and drives engagement towards other aspects of audiovisual works obtained through exploration. I expect to highlight audiovisual narrative aspects like the artist and crowd by capturing an artist involvement and influence on members of the event whilst learning to capture audiences through different media channels. By the end of this semester, I would like to see a live stream of an event that involves levels of user engagement and participation. </p>

 <h3>Creative Technologies Proposition</h3>
<p>Applying a transmedial strategy covering several aspects of the film coverage including artist backgrounds. Narrative aspects include: sound and visual. How these play out through various media channels is part of the exploration into driving user engagement and involvement to create derivative narratives. The maximisation of these elements will involve strategizing audience accessibility and involvement with a repository of artist video sets which aim to cover an event narrative in audiovisual format. This involves some creative film technique and collaboration with other medium artists who have an ideas towards what would work best. The website serving these videos will also have artist and venue information and blog content to support user behaviour. This involves levels of programming and content strategies to drive user engagement towards relevant resources. Another focus, is to investigate different approaches to maximise the events narrative. What is the context of the event? Who are the people involved? How can I participate? This project explores various mediums with a transmedial approach to create an audiovisual story and derivative narratives, that aim towards to maximising the audiovisual.</p>
